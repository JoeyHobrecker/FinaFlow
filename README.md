# Task Manager

FinaFlow is an in-browser task and project manager. All data is stored locally using IndexedDB through Dexie.js so no server setup or login is required.

Open `index.html` to access the main menu and launch the task manager interface in `finaflow.html`.

## Development

All functionality lives in the two HTML files and the bundled Dexie library. Simply open the files in a modern browser. Data persists in your browser until cleared.
