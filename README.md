# Task Manager

FinaFlow is an in-browser task and project manager. Data is stored locally using IndexedDB through Dexie.js and also synced to Firebase Firestore so your tasks follow you across devices.

Open `index.html` to access the main menu and launch the task manager interface in `finaflow.html`.

## Development

All functionality lives in the two HTML files and the bundled Dexie library. Simply open the files in a modern browser. Data is saved locally and synced to Firestore whenever you hit a Save or Update button.
