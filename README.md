# Task Manager

FinaFlow is an in-browser task and project manager. Data is stored locally using IndexedDB through Dexie.js.

Open `index.html` to access the main menu and launch the task manager interface in `finaflow.html`.

## Development

All functionality lives in the single HTML file and the bundled Dexie library. Simply open the file in a modern browser. Use the **Data** view to create JSON backups or restore from them.
